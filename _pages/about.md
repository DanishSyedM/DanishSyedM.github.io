Hey! I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna, working under the guidance of [Prof. Sudhir Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/ksudhiriitk/home?authuser=0). 

Currently, as a part of my Bachelor Thesis I am working at the intersection of Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, with emphasis on Human Activity Recognition using CSI (Channel State Information) data.
